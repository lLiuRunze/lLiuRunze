### MY Capital (AUM: ¬•20B) | Quantitative Researcher Intern  
*2025.07 - 2025.09 | Hainan*  
- Built a high-performance factor evaluation framework with **Polars**; developed an RL-based factor mining system using minute-level OHLC data (out-of-sample IC > 0.09)  
- Constructed a multi-GPU parallel MoE/GRU model for daily multi-factor integration (Sharpe > 2 | 25% annualized return | turnover < 6% in backtests)  
- Designed a CNN-based intraday K-line image recognition system (out-of-sample IC > 0.11 via 3-year rolling predictions)

### Long Life Investment (AUM: ¬•10B) | Quantitative Researcher Intern  
*2025.01 - 2025.04*  
- Reproduced & optimized Attention-LSTM/MASTER models (prediction IC improved to 0.12); built a proprietary DL training framework  
- Achieved 19% annualized return | max drawdown < 6% | Sharpe > 2.5 under ¬•10M+ capital (with Barra neutralization)

## üöÄ Key Projects  
### Machine Learning Strategy Based on Multi-Frequency Factor Synthesis  
*2025.06*  
- Created 100+ feature factors using 1-minute & daily market data; applied **LightGBM** for nonlinear integration (overall IC 0.09 | daily avg IC 0.07)  
- Backtest results: 40% annualized return | 15% max drawdown (¬•10M capital | 0.15% transaction cost)

### Stock Limit-Up/Down Prediction with ML  
*2024.11 - 2024.12*
